# Heart Failure Prediction Analysis
****Introduction****
This repository houses a deep analytical study of heart failure prediction using a public dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project employs a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to predict heart failure mortality based on clinical records.

**Dataset**
The dataset used includes key clinical features that are considered important indicators of heart failure. We conducted a meticulous preprocessing step to ensure the quality and integrity of the data used for model training and validation.

****Analysis****
The R scripts provided enable an interactive exploration of the dataset, covering aspects such as age, blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, and other vital signs. With detailed normality checks and data visualization, we strive to understand the underlying distribution and relationship between different clinical factors.

****Models and Methodology****
We employed several modeling techniques such as:
- Ridge Regression
- LASSO Regression
- Logistic Regression

These models were evaluated based on their performance metrics and their ability to predict the outcome accurately, with detailed RMSE calculations for both training and testing datasets.

****Results****
Our models highlight key predictors of heart failure and quantify their impact. We present a nuanced understanding of model performance, discussing implications and potential improvements.

****Conclusion****
The repository concludes with a selection of the best-performing model based on AIC and BIC scores, providing a valuable tool for healthcare analytics and clinical decision-making.
